TODO for adduser
----------------

Development of adduser 4.0 which is a complete rewrite in C and Shell happens
at the moment in a private CVS Repository and if this is demanded I'll move it
to cvs.d.o or somewhere else where more people have access.

For adduser 3.x there is to do:
 o Make adduser and deluser use strict and taint mode
