TODO for adduser
----------------

currently the following items are on my wishlist:

 * fixing the bugs that are currently assigned to adduser (this has the
   highest priority and will happen before anything else)
   - better handling of nscd (need help here)
   
 * clean up the code (might happen step by step while working on the other
   tasks)

 * more translations (need help from others here ;) if you would like to
   help me here just translate the .po-file and fill a wishlist bug or
   send it directly via private mail to me; note: please use the latest
   version from unstable for this)

 * add a interactive frontend for creating and removing users
   (console-based using libterm-stool-perl)
