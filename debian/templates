Description: Do you want world-wide readable home directories?
 Normally, home directories can be viewed by all users on the system, thus
 they are world-wide readable. If you want to increase the security/privacy
 on your system, you might want your home directories only readable by the
 user. If you are unsure, answer yes to enable world-wide readable home
 directories.
