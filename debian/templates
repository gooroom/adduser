_Description: Do you want system wide readable home directories?
 Normally, home directories can be viewed by all users on the system. If
 you want to increase the security/privacy on your system, you might want
 your home directories only readable by the user. If you are unsure,
 enable system wide readable home directories.
 .
 This will only affect home directories of users added with the adduser
 program later.
