Description: Add users and groups to the system.
 This package includes the adduser and deluser commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
 Adduser can create new users and groups and add existing users to
 existing groups.
 .
 Deluser can remove users and groups and remove users from specific
 groups.
 .
 Adding users with adduser is much easier than adding them by hand.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, allow you to set an
 initial password and gecos.
 .
 Deluser can optionally remove and backup the user's home directory
 and mail spool or all files on the system owned by him.
 .
 Optionally a custom script can be executed after both commands.
